## Experiment 1
- The phase plots were plotted for values of b ranging from 0 to 1 and I\_ext ranging from 0 to 3.
- As the values of I\_ext increased for a fixed value of b, the neuron varied from a a fixed point to a limit cycle and then again a fixed point behaviour. 
- As the value of b increased, the value of I\_ext for which a limit cycle bevaviour was observed also increases
